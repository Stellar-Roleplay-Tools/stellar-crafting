## Stellar Crafting

Live at: [https://stellar-crafting.netlify.app/](https://stellar-crafting.netlify.app/)

This readme is pretty informal as this wasn't meant to be some complex project, just a quick tool for my friends to use.

### Features

- Coming Soon

### Roadmap

- List items available, filtered by bench and searchable from a header search bar
- Adding items to a crafting list
- Show a breakdown of materials needed to make items
- Show how much time it'll take to craft an item/whole list

### Tech Info

Here is the tech I used at-a-glance

- Svelte 4.2.12 / SvelteKit 2.4.0
- Typescript 5.3.3
- TailwindCSS 3.4.1
- SkeletonCSS 2.8.0
- Svelte Icons 2.1.0

### Running Locally

It's a straight-up SvelteKit out-of-the-box app, so just clone the repo, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to get it running locally or your flavor of package management.
I'm using pnpm myself.
